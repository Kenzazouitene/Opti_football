This is the README for the Maximising the social and economical impact of a football club
=======

Abstract
-------

The intention of this optimisation was to maximise the growth of a football team. The social & economical impact as well as the earnings of a football club were identified to affect the most this outcome. A model linking the impact to variables was regressed to be optimised. The fmincon function with different algorithms was used to find solutions for this problem. The outcome is a design tool that determines the ideal ingredients that contribute to the best potential impact to the environment. A stadium capacity of 40000, with a football squad comprised of 46% English players and 38% wins translates to an index of 7.  The next steps of this project would be to sample data on more teams and define more accurately both the contraints and the range space.


Main script 
-------
The social_economical_impact.m MATLAB script should be run entirely

Execution time
-------
The execution time is approximately 0.134805 seconds.

Dependencies
-------
The script requires the add-on symbolicpolynomials, the csv actualstatistics13 as well as MATLAB_R2018b
